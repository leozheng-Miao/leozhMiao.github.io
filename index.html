            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, everyone. My name is Zheng Miao and I’m an international student of RMIT from China. It’s my first year studying in Bachelor of Information Technology and I hope it would be a good start of my abroad studying. It is regrettable that because of COVID-19 virus, I have to stay in China with online courses through Canvas. This time last year I was already anticipating several travel plans when I arrived in Melbourne, and I’m looking forward to making these plans happened in this summer. Back to my introduction, there are reasons for different species about why I chose RMIT. Firstly, RMIT is ranked 223rd in the 2021 QS World University Rankings and 301st-350th in the 2021 THE World University Rankings, high quality of education is the main reason why I chose this school. Secondly is location. Studying abroad is not just learning subject skills, but also a chance to feel local culture. A new country, new environment, new type of faces, and different life style, it must be a lot of fun of studying in Melbourne. About hobbies, I do love playing table tennis as I was a professional table tennis player for 6 years. What’s more, I enjoy watching sports games such as Top 5 European Leagues and NBA, and my favourite clubs are FC Barcelona and Lakers.

          <div class="interest article">
          <h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h3>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a kid I had a great curiosity in computers, a case plus a monitor can actually do so many things. It wasn't until I got older that I learned that something called code was behind the creation of these applications and displays. It was really very interesting, and it seemed like code was everything. Then later, I chose to major in IT. This time, I didn't want to just be a spectator, I wanted to be a creator, learning and progressing in the world of information technology.</p>
          <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why choose RMIT I have explained in the personal information above. High-quality teaching standards and geographical advantages in the heart of a large city. And I have always had the idea of studying abroad. By the way, I would like to thank my parents for their contribution, without their financial and moral support I would not have been able to take the path of studying abroad.</p>
          <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, the first thing was to learn more in my professional skills. Secondly, I want to learn how to work with a team and face the difficulties in my discipline together, which may be another challenge for me. I also hope that in the future I will not let myself down and have my own place in the professional field.</p>

            <h2>Experienced JavaScript Web Developer</h2>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This job advertisement is looking for an experienced developer who can assist in the implementation of web-based e-commerce systems, master Javascript operations, and have advanced technology and serverless architecture. The ad suggests that after the interview, the employee will work with an experienced team and have a number of growth opportunities and rewards. The job is focused on full-time network developers and the ability to focus on customer service. Be responsible for new site projects, and employees must contribute from the time they start creating the site to the time they are finally implemented.

The company is conveniently located in Melbourne's CBD. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, I like front-end projects like creating web pages. As the test results below show, I am a visual learner. This more visual work of front-end development is better suited to me than back-end development. And the job in advertising is not just front-end development, it's also a challenge to understand the knowledge and skills of other parts. In my opinion, life can not be as dull as water, from time to time the waves can maintain my enthusiasm.</p>
            <h4>Skills I have</h4>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, for all the technical requirements mentioned in the ads, it's not impossible for me to meet them now. Now I have a preliminary understanding of linux and MySQL, html and css technical experience is still in the fur phase, JS technology is the same. My java language is more proficient, but it doesn't seem to matter that much in this job.</p>

          <h1>Personal Profile</h1>
        </div>
        <h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;My result is adventurer. It says that adventurer personalities are true artists, however in my past twenty-one years life I didn’t realize that I have an art cell. Though I have had good achievements in the field of music, such as singing experience in school evenings. I don’t think I have the level of artist. Other descriptions truly fit my life. Adventurers live in a colorful, sensual world, inspired by connections with people and ideas. These personalities take joy in reinterpreting these connections, reinventing and experimenting with both themselves and new perspectives. No other type explores and experiments in this way more. This creates a sense of spontaneity, making Adventurers seem unpredictable, even to their close friends and loved ones. </p>
          <h2>Strengths</h2>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Adventurer personalities, they are charming, imaginative and full of passionate. In addition, adventurers easily relate to others’ emotions, helping them to establish harmony and good will, and minimize conflict.</p>
          <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;They are fiercely independent, unpredictable, easily stressed and fluctuating self-esteem. Sometimes, they also get overly competitive, adventurers can escalate small things into intense competitions, turning down long-term success in their search for glory in the moment, and are unhappy when they lose.</p>
          <h2>Team Composition</h2>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the workplace, adventurers seek out positions that give them as much wiggle room as possible to do things their own way. Button-down environments that revolve around tightly held traditions and strictly enforced procedures are unlikely to appeal to adventurer personalities. This means that adventurers are more likely to be the most creative in work and group activities. However at the same time, the sometimes excessive competitive mentality of adventurers will not allow them to easily accept creative failure or not be recognized. Adventurers need to control their emotions in teamwork to ensure that their creative talent will not be hindered.</p>

          <h2>Test Two</h2>
          <h5>Learning Style</h5>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that I’m a Visual learner. It’s truly that I understand and remember things by sight. I can picture what you are learning in my head, and learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. A visual learner is usually meat and clean. He often close his eyes to visualize or remember something, and he will find something to watch if he become bored.</p>
          <h2>Test Three</h2>
          <h5>Big 5 Factors</h5>
          <div class="photo3">

        </div>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure above is the result. It shows that my agreebleness and conscientiousness scores are the highest. A person whose high score in agreebleness and conscientiousness is friendly, optimistic, careful and diligent. The result of emotional stability looks not good, and it must be changed.</p>
          <h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really useful to me. These test results let me know more about myself, the strengths and weaknesses of my personality, when it has blockbuster potential, and when there will be some uncontrolled risks.</p>
          <h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take these results as the standard, always pay attention to their own manners. I don’t hesitate to show my strengths while team tasks are in place. Also, I will strive to improve and correct the various shortcomings and weaknesses mentioned in the test results.</p>
          <h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;My test results show that I like to be behind the scenes. Indeed, if anyone else is up to the task of presenting things such as preaching, I can accept being a green leaf. So I give priority to people like that when I form a team.</p>

          <div id="Project Idea" class="everyTitle">
          <h1>Project Idea</h1>
        </div>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of this project is university information consulting robot. It provides a variety of user interfaces, for complex multithreading, concurrent connections, his chat interface can be implemented. The project provides a normal text-based user interface, allowing users to enter text content and voice content. It can remember the questions that users have asked, so that users have a better second use experience. Artificial algorithm is one of the core technologies. At the same time of user query, the system will automatically analyze, understand the user's needs, and give the most accurate answer. At the same time, the system will integrate the query data of multiple users to simulate the most common problems. The user interface supports any form of chat, which helps users express their ideas more accurately.	</p>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, many universities have their own online websites and have a comprehensive online student service. RMIT has done a good job in this regard. But in China, more schools don't value online services. This leads to students having to ask a lot of people's advice when they deal with the affairs about their studies. This is very inefficient. In 2019, a poll by China University information network showed that 87 percent of Chinese college students did not like the school handling system, 62 percent of which even reached the level of hatred. Voters also have a straightforward reason to choose, and they don't want to spend 200 percent of their energy on a 20 percent job. Therefore, it is very necessary for a college information consulting robot. It can greatly shorten the time students take to go through the formalities. Just move your fingers in the dormitory to type, and you can understand what to do next.</p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The system consists of five main parts. User login interface, robot consultation chat interface, voice recognition, history chat recording function and FAQ ranking. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The user must register an account and log in to the system before entering the query interface. The first login users can register their own account under the guidance of the page prompt. The account needs to be bound with at least one kind of information, such as mobile phone number or email. After successful registration, jump to the login interface again, and the user can ask questions after completing the login operation. Users can enter any form of text in the chat interface, which is also mentioned above. Here, we add a special context management module to the robot to record the context. This function can make the dialogue more efficient and concise. The project will add basic chat thesaurus to the robot. At the same time, we will summarize the problems that students may face in advance, and set up detailed solutions for each problem. For example, for the application of changing majors, the chat robot will first give the conditions to apply for changing majors. Secondly, it clearly points out which materials are needed, which departments need to pass the seal permission, and will indicate the contact information of the responsible personnel of each department and the sample of the required materials at the end of the answer. Let users feel like they are reading the school manual. Users can ask questions by voice when chatting, and the robot will automatically recognize the voice and capture keywords, and give accurate solutions to the problems. After each chat, the system will automatically save the chat record, and save it in the special database to save the history. Users can click the history button in the interface to browse the content they have asked. Finally, we will also place a FAQ ranking in the chat interface, and give the most common questions by analyzing the chat data of each user.
</p>
        <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Need to learn Node.js And Java, in the front-end development with these two tools, increase the development content of BOT. In addition, Microsoft has developed a robot framework called BOT framework. Through BOT framework and its cognitive service API, the project can create multi platform products in a relatively simple way. We need MBF technology to create a Skype bot. At the same time, if problems are found, we need to know how to deal with them. Use ngrok to test BOT in Skype and MBF Architecture Simulator. The chat robot of this project is customer service in essence, and the work of customer service is basically monotonous. We need to create a natural language processing model and use LUIS(language understanding intelligent service) to replace human.</p>
        <h2>Skills Required</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Machine learning and deep learning: This is the most basic technology to master. For example, the classification algorithm can be used to classify users' intention, the language model can be used to filter whether the sentences after speech recognition are smooth, and the clustering algorithm can be used to analyze users' query habits. As users use more and more data, what can give play to deep learning is to further improve the basic technical ability of chat robot. Database technology: through database technology, the robot can quickly retrieve similar sentences in the large-scale corpus stored in advance, and can also store and further analyze the interactive data of many users. Moreover, database technology is essential for the historical record function of the project.
          Acoustic technology: including speech recognition, speech synthesis, etc., provides more expressive force for chat robots. Acoustic technology is also associated with chips and hardware.</p>
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If the project is successful, the first thing to do is to promote it in Chinese universities and cooperate with the school officials. Once the project is implemented, all college students can enjoy the convenience of the project. It improves the efficiency of students to go through all kinds of procedures in the school. Compared with the previous need to aimlessly walk in each school teaching building, the project can let students experience the school online service project efforts. On the other hand, it can help students concentrate on their study and not have to spend energy on other unnecessary things.</p>
